### Brief Project Details

This project is dedicated to Jörg Brunsmann's assignment to recreate the card game "Nope" in a modified way. 

Two custom made AIs will fight against each other in a session and communicate each other through a server which also stores information about the according session.

Every team member works on their own AI while the whole team is supposed to create the server and its database.

The first show-off will be held on 16th may while the final presentation will be held on the 13th June.
